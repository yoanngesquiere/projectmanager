projectmanager
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yoanngesquiere/projectmanager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yoanngesquiere/projectmanager)

My first project under Symfony2.
My goal is to learn how to develop using Symfony2 (so some parts may be poorly developed) making a tool that can be useful for me.
I also use this project to learn some other things like using Behat or configuring travis ci.

All advices are welcomed.
